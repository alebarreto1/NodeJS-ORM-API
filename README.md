### Topics summarizing this repository:
- Going beyond basic MVC layers by organizing the api to grow;
- Creation of an API with NodeJS and some of its main libraries;
- Learning in practice how an ORM works;
- Using Sequelize to refine database queries;
- Development of an application organized in the MVC model.

### MVC: 
- MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic. It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display. This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.

- An architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller:

#### MODEL: 
- Corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components or any other business logic-related data.

#### VIEW:
- Used for all the UI logic of the application. 

#### CONTROLLER:
- Act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output.
